# 📺🚫 Youtube blocker userscript

This project provides the productivity tool that allows you to take your video content consumption under control. It was created as a userscript js file that can be easily included by your web browser.

> Userscripts (a.k.a User Scripts, User scripts, or .user.js) are open-source licensed add-ons for web browsers that change web pages as they are loaded. They give users the power to make websites do what they want them to, rather than what was originally intended. This kind of script is usually file named on your computer as site it affects - what useful name you want to call it.user.js and always does end in .user.js.
